The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:</p> <p>TERM 1 Research: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.</p> <p>TERM 2 Design: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.</p> <p>TERM 3 Development: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.</p> <p></p> <p>Fab Lab Barcelona (IAAC) &amp; Fab City Foundation</p> <p>The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1<sup>st</sup> person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises and personal coaching.</p> <p>Keywords: Prototyping, 1<sup>st</sup> Person Research through Design, Design Space, Documentation and Communication, Design Interventions</p>"},{"location":"#learning-objectives","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<p>The specific goals are the following:</p> <ol> <li>To develop a critical position in the student\u2019s design practice.</li> <li>Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals.</li> <li>Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate.</li> <li>To build personal and collective repositories of resources.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#schedule","title":"Schedule","text":"03/10 <p>Landing Kick off - What\u2019s your purpose</p> <p>Goals: This session will be part of the landing week activities.

Being resilient and resourceful as a professional. Learn about 1PP RTD iterative design interventions methodology.</p> <p>Activity 1: From the different roles that prototypes play in design research, reflect which ones you have used in the past and which ones you could include in your practice.</p> <p>Activity 2: Bring a random scrap material from home. Use the material to sketch a prototype of another colleague\u2019s inquiry.</p> <p>Deliverable: Write a post on your website describing your own RtD toolbox based on your vision and identity. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use based on the context you are in.</p> <p>Schedule: Each session will start with a 15-minute check-in round and end with a 45-minute collective reflection space to share experiences and identify collaborative goals.</p> 16/10 <p>:fontawesome-solid-bolt-lightning: Design Studio Reviews</p> 23/10 <p>Areas of interventions in a Multiscalar Design Space.

The last few years I was focused in the implementation of the newest natural park of Catalonia. </p> <p>Improving the coexistence between human beings and the nature of which we are a part is my main goal. I love sustainable design and architecture. A few years ago I was fascinated by biomimicry and how it can help us find better ways to relate to nature.  I am currently refocusing my professional career towards biomimicry design.</p> <p>I love working in a multidisciplinary team, learning together and helping others achieve their goals.
