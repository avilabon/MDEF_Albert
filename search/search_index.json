I love sustainable design and architecture. A few years ago I was fascinated by biomimicry and how it can help us find better ways to relate to nature.  I am currently refocusing my professional career towards biomimicry design.</p> <p>I love working in a multidisciplinary team, learning together and helping others achieve their goals. In my free time I love to collaborate on citizen science projects, diy, cycling, playing volleyball and hiking.

How do I feel trying to communicate with car drivers? Initial idea: I\u2019m gonna stick a message on my back and chest addressed to the drivers. Then I will go out for a bike ride on a road without a bike lane that I normally ride my road bike and I will record a video to see what happens, if anything happens. The rain and the wind don\u2019t allow me! Second idea: There is little time left so I will use the daily trip from the bus stop to the IAAC by bike to do the test so I put a sign saying good morning on the front that can be read with the rearview mirrors and another one in my backpack and I start pedaling through the streets of Barcelona.

Why? \u25cf Should I use words, icons or emoticons? \u25cf How visible must the messages be in order to attract attention?</p> </li> <li> <p>I am somewhat shy and I have a family and a reputation to maintain. Well, it\u2019s all excuses, the truth is that it embraces me. This has been a test of self-improvement. I passed the test!</p> </li> <li> <p>After wearing the message for a while I almost forgot.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the traffic lights I feel ashamed again. Camouflaging a little with a helmet and sunglasses helps to deal with it.</p> </li> <li> <p>The city is full of strange things and people dressed in all kinds of clothes. A guy with some messages stuck on his body doesn\u2019t stand out too much.</p> </li> <li> <p>The city is full of inputs such s people, cars, signals, noise, pedestrians\u2026 If I want the message to reach its destination, should the message be brighter? Maybe some lights?</p> </li> <li> <p>I have seen and recorded on video many traffic violations, especially for bicycles and pedestrians. Also an accident with an electric scooter and a pedestrian who crossed without looking. It seems like it wasn\u2019t very serious but the girl on the scooter fell to the ground and she will be angry all morning. I tried to calm her down but she was full of adrenaline from shock.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is better not to use the mobile stabilizer to record on the bike. It is better not switch off the stabilizer to record on the bike. It is better not to fix the mobile phone to the handlebars of the bike when it is a simple folding bike.</p> </li> <li> <p>A first-person exploration should be long-term to be more effective, revealing and transformative.</p> </li> <li> <p>The experimental design of a first-person exploration must be very well done or have an adaptive design time to adjust the experiment well and get the most out of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the main conclusions has been that the experience has been poorly designed by me and I have not been able to test it in ideal conditions.
