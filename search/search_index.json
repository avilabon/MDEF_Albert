Is AI the new fentanyl of creativity and self-thinking?</p> <p>Before doing the seminar, my knowledge of artificial intelligence was only at the user level. While it is true that AI, in its different forms, is already implemented in many functionalities of the software, websites, apps and objects that we use daily, I must confess that, consciously, I only used it in a very restricted situations in the professional field. Some examples are the identification of plants and animals species, bird song recognition or for the searching for certain patterns in acoustic recordings for the study of some animal species. Although it is true that on some occasions I had chatted with ChatGPT, I must admit that I was only satisfied with their responses when I had no opinion or had very little knowledge about the topic of conversation. For this reason, I find it very useful to summarize or to introduce myself to new topics. When I got to the master\u2019s degree, I was surprised by the high level of use and skill with ChatGPT and other AI apps that most of my young classmates had.</p> <p>For me and for most of the people around me, AI is something that fascinates and scares in equal parts. Thanks to the seminar, the black box that surrounded AI has become a little more gray and translucent, although I still understand very little of what happens inside. I have managed to begin to glimpse elements that make it up, such as neural networks, models, datasets\u2026 Now, even with my deep gaps on the subject, I may be able to propose projects that uses and takes advantage of this technology. I am particularly interested in everything related to latent space as a multidimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events.</p> <p>Seeing the acceleration that the use and power of AI currently has, I am raised with ethical questions and questions about the future of humanity that I previously saw as very distant and now I see them around the corner. Humanity is being provided with a new and powerful substance but not the instructios book on how to proceed with it, without knowing the contraindications or side effects. It seems to me that if we don\u2019t learn how to self-control and how to use it, AI is going to be the fentanyl of our own thinking and creativity. </p> <p>At the same time that I have seen wonderful things, I have also seen people ask to AI questions before trying to answer them themselves, about personal issues that no one knows better than the people asking. I have seen how a question to AI can turn an agreement into a discussion or a new focus of mental scattering. Will we end up mentally zombies? Let\u2019s hope not, it won\u2019t take long to see how it evolves. In my opinion, AI is hacking the way of working and learning and we must find mechanisms to educate that allow us not to lose our ability to learn and think for ourselves. </p> <p>AI is an exciting topic that gives a lot to reflect about, I have not gone into the great advantages in many fields and benefits that bring to us, neither about the bias or the great ecological impact that it causes. I will inevitably continue to reflect on the subject.</p>"},{"location":"term1/10-DesignDialogs/","title":"Design Dialogs &gt; Term 1","text":"<p>Design Dialogs exhibition</p>"},{"location":"term1/10-DesignDialogs/#simplified-design-space-with-1st-term-interventions","title":"Simplified Design Space with 1<sup>st</sup> Term Interventions","text":"<p> The figure represents a simplified diagram of the elements of my design space related to the interventions developed during the first term.</p>"},{"location":"term1/10-DesignDialogs/#beyond-microfibers-contamination","title":"Beyond microfibers contamination","text":"<p>I have taken advantage of the showcase that the Design Dialogs space offers us to investigate and share a topic that has been hovering on my mind for a long time, synthetic microfibers.</p> <p>The problems caused by synthetic microfibers in the oceans have been known for some time by the scientific community, but this knowledge does not yet translated into significant changes at the legislative level to reduce, control or avoid this contaminant.</p> <p>With the help of a microscope, I have been able to show visitors the microfibers collected at home from different household activities.</p> <p>I have also been able to confirm that the vast majority of people who have visited my space were not aware of this serious environmental problem.</p> <p>However, the problem was quickly understood and I received some very interesting suggestions.</p>"},{"location":"term1/10-DesignDialogs/#microfibers-poster","title":"Microfibers poster","text":""},{"location":"term1/10-DesignDialogs/#to-know-more-about-microfibers","title":"To know more about microfibers","text":"The story of microfibers The microfibers problem <p>Jean-Pierre W.

I have also created a new category of cards called \u201cMind the blackhole\u201d to introduce important nuances to some of the cards I have used.</p> Weak Signal Description Although it is not a new concept, degrowth may probably be the only viable option to stay within planetary boundaries. Degrowth proposes a change in economic objectives and a rational, controlled and conscious decrease in consumption and production. Every day the storage and transfer of information over the Internet increases. Cloud services are increasing day by day and this rise is accompanied by an increase in the ecological footprint. This signal is not weak but its exponential acceleration justifies its inclusion in the Atlas The availability of anything anywhere at any time turns commerce into an unprecedented logistical madness with a first-rate ecological impact. In order to live together we have to learn to share, to give without expecting anything in return. Design, although sustainable, normally focuses on humans and their requirements. Maybe the time has come to start designing for other species, even if we don\u2019t see what benefit we humans are going to get. Let\u2019s not forget that in natural ecosystems everything is interconnected. Mind the blackhole Description This card is an important reminder for me. I think we must not forget that scalability can cause a loss of local diversity. What do we understand by collaboration between species? This card is a warning to be alert that what may seem like collaboration to us can be full-blown exploitation. We must ask ourselves what benefit the parties obtain from this collaboration.

Every project we work on, every new learning we acquire, every success and every failure can modify this space. My design space is organized in constellations. The constellations are set by concepts, elements, feelings or things that do not easily change over time, elements that have been living with me for a long time. These constellations are made up of small galaxies of elements related to each other. At the same time, there are relationships and influences between these elements that surpass the constellations. I think that the design space is something \u2018alive\u2019, something to go to regularly to refresh intentions, to modify it with new interests and feelings. In short, Design Space seems to me to be a very good tool in constant evolution that helps us understand and develop ourselves as designers.

A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects by layering material based on a digital design. Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design.</p> <p>How does it work?  The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design.</p> <p>How it\u2019s built?  The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process.</p> <p>Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore?

I enjoyed like a child discovering the intimacies of some of the machines that surround us.

Later we verified that the vast majority of the parts worked perfectly which did not save them from going to the trash. </p> <p>What world do we live in where it is cheaper to buy a new device than to repair one that has 90% or more of its components in good condition? How we got here? Who receives the consequences of this madness? And from here comes a motivation. This is so absurd we have to fix it!</p> <p>We have been able to verify that in many cases the company that designs does not manufacture most of the components that make up the devices internally. These components are manufactured here and there by companies that specialize in small internal components.</p> <p>In our case, the 3D printer, is a very special case as it comes from an open design project. RepRap is a project to develop low-cost 3D printers that can print most of their own components. As open designs, all of the designs produced by the project are released under a free software license, the GNU General Public License.  In this link you can find an interesting news about a RepRapBNC printer assembly workshop that took place in 2013.</p> <p>When designing and prototyping something useless leads to a lot of useful learning!</p> <p>Once the machines were disassembled and the components checked, we were given the challenge of building a new machine without any commercial purpose, using parts of the original machine. If disassembling an object and testing its parts separately had already been interesting and fun, it has been even more so to build something different inspired by the first one. </p> <p>At this stage of the seminar the coordination of the group and the internal roles of the members has also been an interesting learning point. We were asked to divide ourselves by abilities and skills to have balanced groups.
