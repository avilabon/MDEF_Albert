The last few years I was focused in the implementation of the newest natural park of Catalonia. </p> <p>Improving the coexistence between human beings and the nature of which we are a part is my main goal. I love sustainable design and architecture. A few years ago I was fascinated by biomimicry and how it can help us find better ways to relate to nature.  I am currently refocusing my professional career towards biomimicry design.</p> <p>I love working in a multidisciplinary team, learning together and helping others achieve their goals. In my free time I love to collaborate on citizen science projects, diy, cycling, playing volleyball and hiking. As well as spending quality time with family and friends.</p> <p>\u2026</p>"},{"location":"term1/01-Landing/","title":"Landing week","text":"<p>It\u2019s been a bit of a bumpy landing for me.

At the moment it is a little heeled due to old currents but we hope to focus soon and correct course.</p> Info <p>Almost everything is new.

In this area, practically all interventions on the ground are like prototypes. We practically never have a finished product. The management is continuous because the users are in constant evolution (change). The natural environment is changing and it es subject to multiple variables and interactions that we cannot totally control. Work with living beings and natural systems implies always using adaptive management. That is to say that we are constantly evaluating results and indicators of our actions to adapt subsequent planning to get closer to the conservation objectives.</p> <p>We invent conservation actions, we test study methodologies with new techniques, we create coexistence policies that we adapt and protocolize as they give results.
