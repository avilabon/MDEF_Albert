GMOs may be used for a variety of purposes, such as making human insulin, producing fermented beverages and developing pesticide resistance in crop plants.</p> <p>What is the purpose of my GMO?</p> <p>Synthetic microfibers have become one of the most important sources of pollution for freshwater systems and the oceans. They also pollute the atmosphere and soil. Like many microplastics, they can affect the health of many species, including humans. A large proportion of these synthetic fibers are caused by household activities. This project is an attempt to understand this problem, create awareness, adopt existing solutions, and design new ones to reduce this problem at the household level <sup>4</sup> <sup>5</sup> <sup>6</sup>.</p> <p>The main purpose is to design an organism capable of trapping microfibers from the environment and accumulating them somewhere where someone can collect them or metabolize them to reduce the pollution they produce. Why not find just a PET-digesting enzyme like PETase found in Ideonella sakaiensis <sup>7</sup>? So far, there have been various attempts to increase the rate of plastic degradation by these organisms. The risk is that if the activity is not so fast, many nanoplastics will be generated, which further increases the problem. </p> <p>There are several attempts to capture, aggregate, or destroy microfibers in water, but I have not found any that try to capture those from the floor and indoor air in homes aside from air filters. This will therefore be the \u201cecological\u201d niche of the new organism, the microfibercatcher that I am designing. I think it is better to prevent these microfibers from reaching aquatic systems, that is, to capture them from the environment and accumulate them so that they can be collected. It goes without saying that the best option would be not to wear synthetic clothing that produces microfibers. </p> <p>My thesis is based on the finding that static electricity acts as a dust trap for fibers and hairs producing the typical balls of dust that run around the house. These lints occur in greater abundance in winter when we wear thicker, more fibrous clothes and use heating, which dries out the environment and causes more static electricity.</p> <p>Looking for static electricity in living beings</p> <p>The first idea was the static electricity of the cat\u2019s fur, but after some quick research, it seems that the cat\u2019s fur doesn\u2019t produce static electricity by itself. It seems that, as in the case of cats and other animals, the static electricity in their hair is associated with the type of hair and the behavior of rubbing on surfaces. I don\u2019t see it as easy to relate it to genetic, so this research, for now, has led me to a dead end.  </p> <p>Not so soon! What if we could find a way to make our pets\u2019 hair self-generate static electricity without harming the animals?</p> <p>Indeed, there are microbes, like Geobacter sulfurreducens capable of building external protein networks of nanowires to exchange electrons outside their cell walls. This was called  microbial nanowires (MNWs). The nanowires are thin structures 3 to 5 nanometers in diameter, 100000 times thinner than human hair. This was discovered by Reguera et al (2005)<sup>8</sup>. After this initial discovery, other research groups have found this characteristic in other types of microorganisms. The list of MNW-producing microorganisms is growing. We can see a summary table collected in the article \u201cMicrobial nanowires: an electrifying tale\u201d <sup>9</sup>. According to this paper, the MNWs discovered at the moment can be classified into three different types. </p> <p>Creating a new organism</p> <p>At this point, and given my limited knowledge of genetic engineering, I will briefly describe the steps to follow without going into too much detail. </p> <p>The organism we want to modify could be any pet that runs around the house, specifically its hair. The trait we want to add is the ability to self-generate electricity to capture dust (microfibres) from the environment.</p> <p>The next step would be to identify the genes responsible for creating the proteins that form the nanowires in some of the microbes that produce them and isolate these genes.</p> <p>From what I\u2019ve read, to change genes in living cells, techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 should be used at this stage. What entails designing the guide RNA that will take the Cas9 enzyme to the sequence we want to modify, in this case the genes that give the characteristics of our beloved host\u2019s hair. If all goes well, this enzyme will cut the target\u2019s DNA at the desired site and insert the sequence with the desired trait.</p> <p>As I suppose we love our pet very much, we will try all this in a fertilized egg.</p> <ol> <li> <p>A bioblitz is an event that focuses on finding and identifying as many species as possible in a specific area over a short period of time.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Seed stratification: https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/seed-stratification-information/ \u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.genome.gov/ \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Boucher, J. and Friot D.

While it is true that AI, in its different forms, is already implemented in many functionalities of the software, websites, apps, and objects that we use daily, I must confess that, consciously, I only used it in very restricted situations in the professional field. Some examples are the identification of plant and animal species, bird song recognition, or searching for certain patterns in acoustic recordings for the study of some animal species. Although it is true that on some occasions I chatted with ChatGPT, I must admit that I was only satisfied with their responses when I had no opinion or had very little knowledge about the topic of conversation. For this reason, I find it very useful to summarize or introduce myself to new topics. When I got to the master\u2019s degree, I was surprised by the high level of use and skill with ChatGPT and other AI apps that most of my young classmates had.</p> <p>For me and for most of the people around me, AI is something that fascinates and scares in equal parts. Thanks to the seminar, the black box that surrounded AI has become a little more gray and translucent, although I still understand very little of what happens inside. I have managed to begin to glimpse elements that make it up, such as neural networks, models, datasets, etc. Now, even with my deep gaps on the subject, I may be able to propose projects that use and take advantage of this technology. I am particularly interested in everything related to latent space as a multidimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events.</p> <p>Seeing the acceleration that the use and power of AI currently has, I am raised with ethical questions and questions about the future of humanity that I previously saw as very distant, and now I see them around the corner. Humanity is being provided with a new and powerful substance, but not the instructions book on how to proceed with it without knowing the contraindications or side effects. It seems to me that if we don\u2019t learn how to self-control and how to use it, AI is going to be the fentanyl of our own thinking and creativity. </p> <p>At the same time that I have seen wonderful things, I have also seen people ask AI questions before trying to answer them themselves, about personal issues that no one knows better than the people asking. I have seen how a question to AI can turn an agreement into a discussion or a new focus of mental scattering. Will we end up mentally zombies? Let\u2019s hope not. It won\u2019t take long to see how it evolves. In my opinion, AI is hacking the way we work and learn and we must find mechanisms to educate that allow us not to lose our ability to learn and think for ourselves. </p> <p>AI is an exciting topic that gives a lot to reflect on, I have not gone into the great advantages in many fields and the benefits that it brings to us, neither about the bias or the great ecological impact that it causes.

Degrowth proposes a change in economic objectives and a rational, controlled, and conscious decrease in consumption and production. Every day, the storage and transfer of information over the Internet increase. Cloud services are increasing day by day, and this rise is accompanied by an increase in the ecological footprint. This signal is not weak, but its exponential acceleration justifies its inclusion in the Atlas The availability of anything anywhere at any time turns commerce into an unprecedented logistical madness with a first-rate ecological impact. In order to live together, we have to learn to share and to give without expecting anything in return. Design, although sustainable, normally focuses on humans and their requirements. Maybe the time has come to start designing for other species, even if we don\u2019t see what benefit we humans are going to get.

Write a collective story","text":"We cannot use words as: <p>I, us, our, me, myself, mine, ourselves\u2026</p> <p></p> <p>It is funny how an accumilation of choices can lead a group of people to come together. People who a little more then a month ago were strangers have become a community working to create a better future. Little did they know that the present was gonna be the craziest challenge they ever faced.The members of the group come from diverse nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, yet collectively, they share a common experience of navigating through the intricate processes of attaining city citizenship and utilizing it to acquire a commute card amidst the challenges of bureaucratic procedures. From this primordial soup of individuals and cultures, however, some questions arise: what is really the difference between their personal and professional identities? Are they only here to work together? It seems more like these players are trying to transform their personal ideals into concrete action.</p> <p>The correct answer to the question doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s up to the group to embark on this new adventure and ask even more questions. Whether it\u2019s by engaging the newfound tools of the world to act on simple interactions, by analysing the enviroment lived to learn learn and learn or to by simply living in community and add up a new experience of co-living with different cultures, languages, materials, technologies, spaces, species\u2026</p> <p>The journey of this eclectic assembly it\u2019s a profound exploration of self within the tapestry of a new society. As they juggle the demands of their individual lives with the collective needs, each member is crafting a unique narrative, shaped by shared struggles and triumphs. This experience may test their limits, but it also offers an opportunity to redefine their understanding of community and identity in an ever-evolving world. The shared adventure forms a community that celebrates milestones, cares for one another, and evolves into a unique system of mutual learning and support.</p> <p>Deep conversations about the future, technology, and all of the possibilities that lie ahead are happening everyday, and it\u2019s up to the group to use them to shape the next part of the story.It can be easy to forget, amidst the noise and haste of constant learning and unlearning, of different ways of doing, that having fun is the key. Engaging in ways of exploration and conversation that spark joy and curiosity, lies the groups hidden path to exploring the unfamiliar.This seemingly infinite and endless network, forking and merging, could, through the constant drive to challenge and prove assumptions, gather inspiring experiences for individuals who want to put themselves in this perspective of reality. This means also realizing failure during the process, an indispensable facet of the human experience.Acknowledging failure not as a dead-end but as a portal to enlightenment, one discovers the essence of resilience and adaptability, not only in learning from personal blunders but also in gleaning wisdom from the experiences of others. Failure constitutes an integral facet of the evolutionary journey. Embracing risk is essential for community advancement, and failure is an inherent component of such risks. Within the realm of uncertainty, novel discoveries await, even if accompanied by potential fear and exposure. Valuable lessons emerge from failure, offering a pathway to address topics often neglected or considered taboo. Risk-taking presents opportunities for the existence of these transformative moments shared together. In addition to learning to value failure, this group learned the power of the collective. Learning with each other means learning from one another. Individual design spaces were deeply enriched and expanded by sharing thoughts and ideas with classmates, and many assigments would have never been achieved without collaboration.</p> <p>If in the future one could observe the life paths followed by each of these people from this moment on. And, at the same time one could overlap the paths they would have followed if they had never met in space time.  Maybe, just maybe we would understand a little bit how this experience has shaped their lives. Between the sunrise and the sunset millions questions will shows up to the brain. by answering those question gente used the vision to noticed the informations and solutions. Vision is different in every gente. Nowdays, gente lived with technology. Also, millions creations borned. The new borned babies involved into Gente-Tech Art movement; where the dream starts to come true.</p> <p>Yet, in the midst of continual learning and unlearning, amidst the various approaches, it\u2019s easy to overlook that fun is essential. Participating in exploratory conversations that spark joy and curiosity unveils the group\u2019s secret journey to explore the unknown. This seemingly boundless and ever-shifting network of connections, with its twists and turns, might, by consistently challenging assumptions, accumulate enriching experiences for those who want to embrace this outlook on reality.</p> <p>Moreover, these diverse experiences and shared challenges of the group risk fading into memory. Documentation,is the useful source to capture the essence of their journey, preserving wisdom from failures and collective learning. It serves as a tangible record, enabling reflection, celebration of milestones, and informed shaping of the group\u2019s future.</p> <p>Time will tell how these group of students are going to be changed as professionals and as individual people.But always are going to have the documentation and the learning of the MDEF year This could be an opportunity to explore what it really means to have every opportunity lie ahead. To understand what it means to be one with everything and nothing in the body of a creator. To realise that every miracle once attributed to a god could also be in a group of 22 (sweetie pie) students who all crossed into one reality by making the same decision to be here. </p> <p>Go to the original doc</p>"},{"location":"term1/03-DesignStudio/03-RolesOfPrototyping/","title":"Design studio: Roles of prototyping","text":""},{"location":"term1/03-DesignStudio/03-RolesOfPrototyping/#roles-of-prototyping-in-1pp-research-through-design","title":"Roles of Prototyping in 1PP Research through Design","text":"<p>3 Perspectives based on Tomico et al.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307605892_A_Systematic_Analysis_of_Mixed_Perspectives_in_Empathic_Design_Not_One_Perspective_Encompasses_All</p>"},{"location":"term1/03-DesignStudio/03-RolesOfPrototyping/#reflection","title":"Reflection:","text":"<p>The combination of the three perspectives seems to be a good formula to enrich design decisions.

A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects by layering material based on a digital design. Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design.</p> <p>How does it work?  The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design.</p> <p>How it\u2019s built?  The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process.</p> <p>Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore?

Later, we verified that the vast majority of the parts worked perfectly, which did not save them from going to the trash. </p> <p>What world do we live in where it is cheaper to buy a new device than to repair one that has 90% or more of its components in good condition? How did we got here? Who receives the consequences of this madness? And from here comes motivation. This is so absurd, we have to fix it!</p> <p>We have been able to verify that, in many cases, the company that designs the devices does not manufacture most of the components that make up the devices internally. These components are manufactured here and there by companies that specialize in small internal components.</p> <p>In our case, the 3D printer is a very special case as it comes from an open design project. RepRap is a project to develop low-cost 3D printers that can print most of their own components. As open designs, all of the designs produced by the project are released under a free software license, the GNU General Public License. In this link you can find interesting news about a RepRapBNC printer assembly workshop that took place in 2013.</p> <p>When designing and prototyping something useless, it leads to a lot of useful learning!</p> <p>Once the machines were disassembled and the components checked, we were given the challenge of building a new machine without any commercial purpose, using parts of the original machine.

We were asked to divide ourselves by abilities and skills to have balanced groups. I guess my colleagues will agree with me that my contribution to the group has been more multi-purpose.

Surely there are many things missing but the current elements are useful to me and it is easy for me to create simplified design spaces that bring together concepts around a specific idea, project or intervention. Therefore, I see it as something that is being useful to me.</p> <p>As I have already explained in previous posts or in the first term final delivery, my desing space is organized in constellations or galaxies of highly close and highly connected elements. Although it is not fully reflected in the design space, in this beginning of the second term I feel that the Constellation of Degrowth has come closer to concepts related to technology. I am still struggling to find a comfortable place between lowtech and hightech but I clearly see that it has become a priority for me to see how technology designed with values \u200b\u200bcan help us to degrowth. I also see biomimetics as a driver to be able to design with values. I invite you to visit the constellation of biomimetics, nature as a mentor.</p> <p>As the first intervention of this quarter, I want to share and compare my final project with the communities of interest and adapt it from the design phase to their requirements, suggestions and needs. On the one hand, I want to share ideas with researchers and directors of citizen science programs to know to what extent my ideas can be useful to them.
