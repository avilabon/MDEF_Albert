The last few years I was focused in the implementation of the newest natural park of Catalonia. </p> <p>Improving the coexistence between human beings and the nature of which we are a part is my main goal. I love sustainable design and architecture. A few years ago I was fascinated by biomimicry and how it can help us find better ways to relate to nature.  I am currently refocusing my professional career towards biomimicry design.</p> <p>I love working in a multidisciplinary team, learning together and helping others achieve their goals. In my free time I love to collaborate on citizen science projects, diy, cycling, playing volleyball and hiking. As well as spending quality time with family and friends.</p> <p>\u2026</p>"},{"location":"term1/01-Landing/","title":"Landing week","text":"<p>It\u2019s been a bit of a bumpy landing for me. Curiously, the landing was not on dry land but on a ship that is leaving with an open, uncertain and exciting destination.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to have to fight with the helm to try to steer this boat. At the moment it is a little heeled due to old currents but we hope to focus soon and correct course.</p> Info <p>Almost everything is new. I quickly look for the first points of reference that give me security. I guess we are all doing the same thing.  It won\u2019t be difficult to feel at home here.
