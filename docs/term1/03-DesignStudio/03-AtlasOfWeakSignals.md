In this seminar we have worked with **The Atlas of the Weak Signals (AOWS)** a toolkit designed by Mariana Quintero. Using an amazing deck of cards, we tried to understand the weak signals (the trends before the trends) and sketch future scenarios from them adding also areas of opportunities and random triggers cards. This tool has helped us set up our own design space.

[More about AOWS](https://fablabbcn.org/blog/emergent-ideas/atlas-of-weak-signals#:~:text=The%20Atlas%20of%20the%20Weak,trends%20in%20our%20current%20world.)

After the presentation, to become familiar with the AOWS framework, we first work on a random example with the whole class and then we practice in smaller groups.


## My own design space

It is not an easy task to choose a few cards from the deck and start designing your own design space. Many of the cards resonate with me and talk about topics that interest me for a long time. Others I barely know what they refer to and I have to look up what they mean.

This is a first attempt to graphically represent my own design space, opening my mind and trying to establish relationships between the elements that compose it.

I have selected the following weak signals to include within my design space:

I am not surprised to see that many of these cards are related to my work background and my previous studies.

## Reflections
 
The design space is a changing thing. Every project we work on, every new learning we acquire, every success and every failure can modify this space. My design space is organized in constellations. The constellations are set by concepts, elements, feelings or things that do not easily change over time, elements that have been living with me for a long time. These constellations are made up of small galaxies of elements related to each other. At the same time, there are relationships and influences between these elements that surpass the constellations. I think that the design space is something 'alive', something to go to regularly to refresh intentions, to modify it with new interests and feelings.
