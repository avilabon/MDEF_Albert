In this seminar we have worked with **The Atlas of the Weak Signals (AOWS)** a toolkit designed by Mariana Quintero. Using an amazing deck of cards, we tried to understand the weak signals (the trends before the trends) and sketch future scenarios from them adding also areas of opportunities and random triggers cards. This tool has helped us set up our own design space.
