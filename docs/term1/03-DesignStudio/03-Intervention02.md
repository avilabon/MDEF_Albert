## Introduction
Plants and fungi are living beings that apparently do not behave in the same way as animals. We know that they grow and change their appearance, but at such a slow speed that they look like inanimate objects. This apparent lack of movement means that most of the time we are not aware that we are surrounded by living beings that breathe, feed and communicate with each other and with the environment.

This intervention aims to magnify these signs of life and communication to make it more apparent that they are living beings like us.
