3 Perspectives based on Tomico et al.

***Reflection:*** The combination of the three perspectives seems to be a good formula to enrich design decisions. I think each perspective brings something meaningful to the design. 1PP gives us more sensitivity, empathy towards users and, why not, also legitimacy.

### The Roles

***Reflection:*** To be honest I must say that often when I try to fit a prototype into a role, I have doubts. To understand it a little better I have read the article (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270511639_Prototypes_and_prototyping_in_design_research) and I have searched for these videos of examples that you can see below.

-   Role 1: The prototype as an experimental component

-   Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry

-   Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry
