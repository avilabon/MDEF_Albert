## Activity 1. Magic machines workshop: make a companion

### Public presentation of Petta

This companion is a kind of live being, at least a piece of organic matter already crafted by nature when we met each other. As a designer I just created a protective capsule and a room. In the room, my companion has three posters about the future. It’s Plan A is to become a Tangerine Tree, Plan B is more “Carpe Diem” let’s flow and Plan C is the same as Plan A but with a longer path, with more steps and with a more blurred final destination. There is a device with 3 buttons that allow to change from one plan to another. During the creation I was thinking in acceptance or rather self-acceptance	
It is not a pet. I repeat, it is not a pet!

#### First feelings
I imagine that this companion will evolve, like us, like most of us! I imagine that it will change it’s appearance. I also imagine that I’ll be able to talk to it and ask it how its day went. And in my future predictions I imagine that one day I will get up in the morning and tell it, friend, are you feeling sick? You're turning a little green! Or maybe, I see you somewhat changed, are you leaving your hair long?


### Living Together. Living with Petta diary.

#### Day 1 (30/10/2023)
- 13:00: Birth. I create a new birthday reminder in Google Calendar. It has the same horoscope as me, this cannot be a coincidence!
- 14:00: Capsule, portable room and decoration
- 16:30: Arrival home. I see, horrified, how the trip has destroyed part of the room. Luckily, the capsule has resisted and the companion has arrived unharmed. 
- 17:00 I restore everything and take the opportunity to make some improvements in fixing the posters.
- 17:30 We look for a suitable place to live. Finally we decided to try, provisionally on a shelf in the library.
- 17:45 I observe a slight humidity in the capsule. We will be alert to how it evolves
- 23:30 I've come home and I'm going to see him. I don't know if I should take it to my room. Maybe my family thinks that this master's degree is affecting my reasoning. I better leave it where it is.


#### Day 2 (01/11/2023)
- 8:00: I wake up and my first impulse is to go visit the “Thing”. I control myself. Wait until after breakfast. It's just a class exercise, isn't it?
- 8:30: Working with living elements is dangerous, you can create bonds!
- 10:00: I finally go up to visit it. The capsule condensation remains the same. We need to give it a name so we don't call it “Thing”. I'm thinking about giving it a nice name that everyone likes. In the five minute limit that I have set for this task I am not able to find anything more cool and original than PEETA (from peel and tangerine).
- 12:00: I think that the posters I have made with PEETA’s future plans were actually mine and that I am playing God. I don't know if I want to continue with the exercise. I think about getting rid of PEETA! But how? Now it has a name! Will I abandon him in the forest? Do I separate it by type of waste and recycle it so as not to have a bad conscience? I simply abandoned it and became part of the club of bastards who do not internalize the externalities of their creations. Designers should not avoid responsibility for their creations.
- 12:30 PEETA, Can I ask you something? When the hell are you going to emancipate yourself?
- 13:00 I calm down. I just have to rethink our relationship. As a father I was adopting an overly paternalistic relationship with PEETA. I simply didn't want to spend 2 more years changing diapers. Call me selfish!
- 16:00 I give him a house key so he can choose freely.
- 17:00 PEETA is still at home. I guess PEETA has freely choose to stay. So PEETA let's establish some rules of coexistence…
