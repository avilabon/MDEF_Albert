# **Design with others**

#From micro to macro
We are not alone. Humans in cities, we are not alone. 
We are surrounded by other living beings that seek shelter and food in the same way we do. These species try to thrive in the microhabitats they find in the ocean of cement, tar and concrete that human settlements have become.

This small intervention aims to bring us closer to these other citizens with whom we share space-time. To discover their secret life, their often nocturnal and crepuscular habits, their marvelous forms, their habitats located in small corners, in interstitial spaces, in places not very accessible to humans. Our goal is to create tools that encourage discussion, knowledge, discovery and art with these other beings to foster a healthier interspecific relationship. A relationship without disgust, without fear and full of wonder and respect.

##Video of testing the prototype with a real community

There are many communities that are not organized or legally constituted. The group with which we tested the prototype is one of these communities. It is a temporary community of girls and boys from different towns near Barcelona who meet during weekends and holidays in a small town in the Pyrenees. There they form a multi-age group where origin, purchasing power or family diversity does not matter. The goal of the community is to have fun and play, and they achieve it day after day filling the streets of the town and its inhabitants with joy.
