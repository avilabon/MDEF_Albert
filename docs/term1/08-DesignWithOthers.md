#From micro to macro
We are not alone. Humans in cities, we are not alone. 
We are surrounded by other living beings that seek shelter and food in the same way we do. These species try to thrive in the microhabitats they find in the ocean of cement, tar and concrete that human settlements have become.
This small intervention aims to bring us closer to these other citizens with whom we share space-time. To discover their secret life, their often nocturnal and crepuscular habits, their marvelous forms, their habitats located in small corners, in interstitial spaces, in places not very accessible to humans. Our goal is to create tools that encourage discussion, knowledge, discovery and art with these other beings to foster a healthier interspecific relationship. A relationship without disgust, without fear and full of wonder and respect.
