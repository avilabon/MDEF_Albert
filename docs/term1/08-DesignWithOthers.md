# **Design with others**

This has been a busy week full of very inspiring projects, places and people. During the sessions facilitated by Holon, we explored and tried to understand a little better the economic, social and political factors involved in land and soil in the city. On a more practical level, we went around the neighborhood in search of elements that caught our attention and tensions. Later, we were grouped by interests in order to design a small intervention with the communities that were working on the same type of tension.

#From micro to macro
We are not alone. Humans in cities, we are not alone. 
We are surrounded by other living beings that seek shelter and food in the same way we do. These species try to thrive in the microhabitats they find in the ocean of cement, tar and concrete that human settlements have become.

This small intervention aims to bring us closer to these other citizens with whom we share space-time. To discover their secret life, their often nocturnal and crepuscular habits, their marvelous forms, their habitats located in small corners, in interstitial spaces, in places not very accessible to humans. Our goal is to create tools that encourage discussion, knowledge, discovery and art with these other beings to foster a healthier interspecific relationship. A relationship without disgust, without fear and full of wonder and respect.

##Video of testing the prototype with a real community

There are many communities that are not organized or legally constituted. The group with which we tested the prototype is one of these communities. It is a temporary community of girls and boys from different towns near Barcelona who meet during weekends and holidays in a small town in the Pyrenees. There they form a multi-age group where origin, purchasing power or family diversity does not matter. The goal of the community is to have fun and play, and they achieve it day after day filling the streets of the town and its inhabitants with joy.


##Reflections
During this seminar, we have seen many projects and we have carried out a small intervention that has not gone beyond a simple real test. However, I feel I was only able to capture a small part of the complexities and tensions surrounding soil and land in the city. 

The city is a paradoxical human creation that, in a certain sense, denatures us since it artificializes us and distances us from nature. On the other hand, it humanizes us since it forces us to find social forms of coexistence. There is an endless struggle in order to renaturalize an environment full of cement, concrete and asphalt in an attempt to bring us back to our origins.

Although I had been away from the social movements of a big city for a long time and was focused on working in a more natural environment, I should confess that I am very positively impressed with some of the projects I have met this week. It seems that where there are more people concentrated, there are also more chances for alliances and projects to emerge that seek profound transformations.

Certainly, deep transformations involve working with creative and engaged human groups and communities. And we must not forget that transforming is a long distance race. Most of the projects we have visited it took a lot of resources, time and energy to establish and operate. We cannot let our guard down because, although they are deeply involved in the neighborhoods, the network of transformative projects still needs to get stronger and resilient to face the future challenges of the Anthropocene.
