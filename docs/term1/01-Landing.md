# **Landing**
![landing](../images/albatroslandinggif.gif) 

It's been a bit of a bumpy landing for me. Curiously, the landing was not on dry land but on a ship that is leaving with an open, uncertain and exciting destination.

I'm going to have to fight with the helm to try to steer this boat. At the moment it is a little heeled due to old currents but we hope to focus soon and correct course.

???+ Impressions
    Almost everything is new. I quickly look for the first points of reference that give me security. I guess we are all doing the same thing. 
    It won't be difficult to feel at home here. Most people in the IAAC-FABLAB ecosystem seem very friendly and empathetic.

## Master's directors and coordinators

Motivating presentation of the master's directors. They are people
who have done amazing projects and continue to work with
commitment and humility. So many things to learn!

The very constant presence of the coordinator is very reassuring. Thank you Chiara!

## Exploring Poblenou Ecosystem with Chiara and Milena

There is nothing better to immerse yourself in a new area than to listen to the people who live there. To get to know the neighborhood better we have taken a tour to visit some interesting and transformative projects. I have been following the Biciclot - BiciHub project for a long time. The others have been an inspiring discovery for me.

Amazing facilities and I don't know how to use most of them...yet!

This is the cradle of design!

## Reflections

Our minds have been shaken by a multitude of things and concepts. Many new ones, others already old friends, others that have metamorphosed since last time... A great week! It is going to be difficult to calm our minds after so much overstimulation!
