# **Bio and Agri Zero**
## Bio Zero
**Is life a mere piece of information that can self-replicate to adapt to environmental conditions?**

Bio Zero has been a journey at the speed of light through concepts and technologies related to life. We have flown over different branches of biology such as molecular biology, microbiology, cellular biology, genetic engineering... And along the way we saw cells, proteins, amino acids, dna, rna, exons and we learned about CRISP-Cas9 and its use in genetic engineering, we saw bacteria, fungi, protists and we spoke about "LUCA",...

We have been able to practice a little preparing low-cost bacteria cultures in petri dishes with almost homemade resources, approaching an invisible world with microscopes and seeing practical applications such as growing spirulina or kombucha.

In addition, throughout the seminar we were able to reflect on the scientific method, experimental design, the peer-review process for publications, the role of science in general, as well as the funding of scientific research and some open science initiatives.

???+ danger "Lab rules"
    1. A clean lab is a safe lab
    2. Read the labels
    3. Extra rule: No not eat your experiments

## Agri Zero

The Agri Zero seminar has been an interesting quick overview of the concepts related to agriculture and other collaterally related topics. 

### Visiting Valldaura Labs
We did a Bioblitz [^1] together from Mundet station to Valldaura Labs. We used [iNaturalist App](https://www.inaturalist.org/) to collect pictures and to identify species thanks to its deep learning-based identification tool built into it.

[^1]:
 A bioblitz is an event that focuses on finding and identifying as many species as possible in a specific area over a short period of time.

### Extracting laurel essential oil

### Analyzing soils
Jonathan provided us with some soils from different sources that we were able to analyze in groups. [Nicolo](https://niente010.github.io/MDEF_website/#welcome) and I analyzed a soil from **Benifallet**.

![Benifallet Soil analysis](../images/AgriZero-SoilAnalysis.PNG)

| Parameter | Value      | Analysis   |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Texture   | Silt Loam  |  Texture   |
| Munsell   | 5YR 5/6    |  Munsell   |
| pH        | 7.6        |pH test|
| NO3       | 50 mg/L    |Nitrate test|
| NO2       | 10 mg/L    |Nitrite test|
| Cl2       | 3 mg/L     |Cl2 test|
| GH        | > 16°d     |     pH     |
| KH        | 10°d       |     pH     |
| PO4       | 0.1 mg/L   |    PO4     |

#### Results interpretation
The Silt loam texture is composed by 75-85% of silt, 20-50% of sand and 0-25% of clay. The Munsell color value of 5YR corresponds to predominantly yellow and orange colors, it can indicate the presence of certain minerals such as iron. The 5/6 values indicate a moderate organic matter content. pH test indicates a value very close to neutral, just slightly alkaline.
The nutrients tests ( hosphorus and nitrogen) have given values not very high.
