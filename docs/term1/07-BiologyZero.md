# **Bio and Agri Zero**
## Bio Zero
**Is life a mere piece of information that can self-replicate to adapt to environmental conditions?**

Bio Zero has been a journey at the speed of light through concepts related to life, quantum mechanics, molecular biology, microbiology, cellular biology, genetic engineering... We have been able to practice a little preparing bacteria cultures in petri dishes with almost homemade resources, approaching an invisible world with microscopes and seeing practical applications such as growing spirulina or kombucha.
