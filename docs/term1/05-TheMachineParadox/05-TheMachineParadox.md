# **The machine paradox**
The Moravec paradox that gives the seminar its name, comes from the paradox that some of the things that are easy for us to do as humans can be very difficult for machines, while some of the things that are difficult for humans they are easy for machines.

## Reflections

This two-week seminar has been very exciting. I enjoyed like a child discovering the intimacies of some of the machines that surround us. Through a [forensic analysis](05-ForensicReport.md) we have seen the components, the materials, the internal design and the operation of the pieces and parts that make them up. Later we verified that the vast majority of the parts worked perfectly which did not save them from going to the trash. 

What world do we live in where it is cheaper to buy a new device than to repair one that has 90% or more of its components in good condition? How we got here? Who receives the consequences of this madness? And from here comes a motivation. This is so absurd we have to fix it!

Once the machines were disassembled and the components checked, we were given the challenge of building a [new machine](05-TheMagicMachine.md) without any commercial purpose, using parts of the original machine.
