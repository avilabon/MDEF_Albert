Iâ€™m an environmental scientist and a GIS analyst currenly working in natural Parks management in Catalonia Nature Parks Network. The last few years I was focused in the implementation of the newest natural park of Catalonia. 

Improving the coexistence between human beings and the nature of which we are a part is my main goal. I love sustainable design and architecture. A few years ago I was fascinated by biomimicry and how it can help us find better ways to relate to nature.  I am currently refocusing my professional career towards biomimicry design.
