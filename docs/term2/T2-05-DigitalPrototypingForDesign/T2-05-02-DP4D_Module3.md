### First steps


### Adapting the first design to the machine

???+ quote "Steps to create Dog-t-bones with Rhino"
    - Draw the rectangle of the shape with the width of the board.
    - Command Circle
    - Click in the center of the circle.
    - Cmd Radius of the circle depending on the size of the container. In our case it is 3mm because the container we are going to use has 6 mm in diameter.
    - Adjust the position of the circle to allow the 6mm tool room to move from the circle to the larger socket.
    - Use Mirrow command to draw circles on the other corners
    - Select all, use Trim command i borre las tramos no necesarios
    - Use join to create a single shape
