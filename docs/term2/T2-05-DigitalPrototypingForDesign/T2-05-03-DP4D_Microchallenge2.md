# **Digital Prototyping For Design: Microchallenge 2 - Dr. Chladni - Individual post**

## Microchallenge 2 report and repository

## Refletions and learnings

### General issues

- Microchallenge 2, being a continuation of the first, has been much more satisfactory in terms of results for us.

### About the project

- Our Chladni plate now works. The constructive experience of the first microchallenge, especially, has been crucial to develop a new Chladni plate in a very short time.

- New questions have arisen behind each small advance or error during the process. This can become never ending story.

- I am very interested in the nature of membranes and how they transmit sound within a certain range of frequencies and stop transmitting it when these boundaries are exceeded, whether above or below. I would like to try biomaterials.

- Our project has been very experimental and involves a lot of research and exploration.

- Beyond the initial objectives of the project, I see a high educational potential derived from it. From the study of waves to the functioning of the eardrum of the human ear for example.

- Perhaps out of desperation but also through perseverance we were able to find new paths to continue our exploration.


### Learnings

**The importance of planning:**

Planning is very important. As we started from a good project planning thanks to microchallenge 1, we have not spent much time deciding what to do and how to do it. Having planned most of our project in advance has allowed the new ideas to fit perfectly without leaving the predetermined framework.

The previous daily meeting to evaluate the status of the project and decide the objectives and distribution of each day's tasks is a very good practice.

**The importance of the team:**

Al continuar trabajando con el mismo equipo, nos ha permitido conocer mejor la manera de trabajar y las habilidades de cada miembro del equipo nos ha permitido segregar algunos de los trabajos para poder acabar dentro de las fechas l√≠mite.




### Contributions

- My contribution to the project may have to be valued by my partner in this microchallenge. However, if I have to evaluate myself, I think I have done the best I could. I have dedicated all the hours that I could. Perhaps time management could have been improved in some phases of the project.

- When things don't work out the way you expect and the deadline is approaching, it's easy to panic, but in those moments it is essential to remain calm so as not to contaminate your partner.

- Having trusted people you know little to create something together that turned out well helps me trust the world.

- I always feel good being able to help other groups with small things like cutting some pieces of metal, making some holes, filling out a survey or designing the new IAAC terrace with VR.

### The process is the way!
