There are several sites where you can select a zone and create a 3D model of terrain. These site are very fast and useful if you feel ok with the information they provide to you. If you want to add more geographic information to the model you should use a geographic information software. Due to my background working with geographic information I feel more confortable controlling all the layers of information so I used QGIS for the first part of the process.



Tutorial:
1) Download Digital Elevations Model (DEM)
2) Generate contours
3) Clean and prepare in an vector design software
4) Laser cut

### Reflection (Facts, feelings, findings and future)

- To be more consistent with these experiments I have decided not to use plastics to create bioplastics. This has sometimes not been the best option because some of the bioplastic formulas stuck to the wood. Sometimes following a cause can present certain drawbacks!

- To create the templates/molds I used 4mm plywood that I cut with the laser. The boards had a bit of curvature and it was difficult in the central part to keep the piece completely flat. There are materials that, despite good storage efforts, deform due to humidity and changes in environmental temperature.

- I must confess that although I still have a lot to learn about laser cutting, I feel comfortable working with it. Being used to working with 2D vector GIS or design programs has made it easier for me to do several tests without spending a lot of time creating the drawing files. On this occasion I have only worked with plywood, I would like to try other materials and techniques in the future. 

- Regarding biomaterials, the size reduction as the materials dry is something difficult to control but must be taken into account.
