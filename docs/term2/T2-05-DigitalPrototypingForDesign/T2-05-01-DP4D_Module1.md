There are several sites where you can select a zone and create a 3D model of terrain. These site are very fast and useful if you feel ok with the information they provide to you. I you want to add more geographic information to the model you should use a geographic information software.

Tutorial:
1) Download Digital Elevations Model (DEM)
2) Generate contours
3) Clean and prepare in an vector design software
4) Laser cut

Due to my background working with geographic information I feel more confortable controlling  all the layers of information.
