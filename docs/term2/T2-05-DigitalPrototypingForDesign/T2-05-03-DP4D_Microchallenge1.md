## Refletions and learnings

- Working in a hurry definitely puts me in a bad mood. But we have improved it by lowering the pressure on the final product.
- New questions have arisen behind each small advance or error during the process. This can become never ending story.
- Our Chladni plate still doesn't work well but I want to solve it. It may seem frustrating but I have a lot of patience and I'm having a good time.
- I am very interested in the nature of membranes and how they transmit sound within a certain range of frequencies and stop transmitting it when these boundaries are exceeded, whether above or below. I would like to try biomaterials.
- Our project has been very experimental and involves a lot of research and exploration.
- Beyond the initial objectives of the project, I see a high educational potential derived from it. From the study of waves to the functioning of the eardrum of the human ear for example.
- I feel much more confident with 3D printing and laser cutting. There are many materials or thicknesses of material that the laser cannot cut but perhaps it can mark it which helps a lot. I already felt very comfortable with power and manual tools before. 
- Working in a hurry definitely puts me in a bad mood. But we have improved it by lowering the pressure on the final product. 
- My contribution to the project may have to be valued by my partner in this microchallenge. If I have to evaluate myself, I think I have done the best I could.
The combination of experience and having different skills helps to manage critical moments.
- In the most critical moments it is essential to remain calm so as not to contaminate your partner.
- In my opinion, taking the time necessary to align interests is essential for the future of the project.
- I think it is good not to limit yourself when designing the project. However, when we already program a specific action within it, we have to be realistic with the time, the materials and the possibilities of learning something new in that period of time.
- Good humor, empathy and a willingness to help are basic in a collaborative environment such as the FabLab. It is not intended to be a criticism but perhaps it would be good to put some indicators to ensure that this is always the case.

- The process is the way!
