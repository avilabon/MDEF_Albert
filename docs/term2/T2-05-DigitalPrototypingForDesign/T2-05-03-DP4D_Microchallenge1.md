## Reflexions

### Specific reflexions and learnings
- New questions have arisen behind each small advance or error during the process.
- Our Chladni plate still doesn't work well but I want to solve it. It may seem frustrating but I have a lot of patience and I'm having a good time.
- I am very interested in the nature of membranes and how they transmit sound within a certain range of frequencies and stop transmitting it when these boundaries are exceeded, whether above or below. I would like to try biomaterials.
- Our project has been very experimental and involves a lot of research and exploration.
- Beyond the initial objectives of the project, I see a high educational potential derived from it. From the study of waves to the functioning of the eardrum of the human ear for example.
- I feel much more confident with 3D printing and laser cutting. I already felt very comfortable with power and manual tools before.

### General reflexions and learnings
- Working in a hurry definitely puts me in a bad mood. But we have improved it by lowering the pressure on the final product. 
- My contribution to the project may have to be valued by my partner in this microchallenge. If I have to evaluate myself, I think I have done the best I could.
The combination of experience and having different skills helps to manage critical moments.
- In the most critical moments it is essential to remain calm so as not to contaminate your partner.
- In my opinion, taking the time necessary to align interests is essential for the future of the project.
- The process is the way!
