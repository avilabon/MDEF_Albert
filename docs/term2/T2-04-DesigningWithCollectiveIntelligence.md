## Reflections

- Many concepts emerged during these days, some new to me and others not so new but in which I personally had not yet delved too deeply.

**Feedback regarding the seminar format:**
My evaluation of the seminar is very good. I think the organizers must be congratulated for their courage and also for their ability to find quick solutions when technical conditions did not help communication. I also think that the work proposed in Miro board was very well designed and worked well in the vast majority of cases.

The theoretical talks were at some times, not all, too fast or superficial or simplified for me, especially when it came to concepts with a lot of theory behind them as blockchain or DAOs. This require more time for those uninitiated in these concepts like me.

My proposal for another seminar is that this theory be given beforehand with a certain amount of time so that the seminar talks are more quick reminders of concepts than theory about these concepts.
