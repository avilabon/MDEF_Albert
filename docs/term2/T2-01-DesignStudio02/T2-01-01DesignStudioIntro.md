# **Design Studio 02**

## Intro day
With the start of the second term, the time has come to start developing our project through more interventions in the real world. We are also encouraged to grow with the community of practice as well as create our own identity and narrative.

??? quote "Some pieces of advice to face what is coming"
    - Never do anything alone
    - Document for yourself and others
    - Rethink what ‘perfect’ means to you
    - Rethink what ‘feeling lost’ might really mean
    - Write to assist your thinking, to find your voice
    - Beyond the hype, commit to your values 
    - Let the project flow with its own trajectory
