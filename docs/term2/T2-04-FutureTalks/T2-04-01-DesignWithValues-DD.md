## Designing with Values. Distributed design. 
***By Jessica Guy and Olga Trevisan***

### Distributed Design
***A new approach to design which utilises global connectivity to move data, instead of products.***

Distributed Design (DD) is collaborative design and fabrication in which tasks, knowledge and resources are distributed among different people or groups of people. It is a decentralized model that allows greater participation and diversity in the design process, as well as flexibility in production since it allows manufacturing locally by adapting designs to local resources. DD fosters open innovation and promotes a sense of community among people, leading to the development of more inclusive, sustainable and impactful designs. This shared resources allows not only to share ideas but iterate on designs and collectively create products or solutions.
