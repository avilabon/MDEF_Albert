# **Critical transfeminist design**

Laura's notes:

"Transfeminism is a part of what is known as new feminisms. It expands the subjects considered within feminism to include others who are also oppressed by cisheteropatriarchy, who are not necessarily cisgender women."

"Transfeminism understand the concept of gender as a social construction used to oppress and exclude"
