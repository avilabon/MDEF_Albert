## Refletions and learnings

### About the project

- Although the whole project was a little stressful, I must confess that I have learned very valuable lessons for my future projects.

- We have created a very basic artificial intelligence model that has allowed us to create a small loop with the Chladni plate patterns and frequencies. Although we must improve the training of the model, this opens the doors to looking for other patterns in nature outside of our frequency-pattern system.

- Microchallenge 2, being a continuation of the first, has been much more satisfactory in terms of results for me.


### Learnings

- Although the whole project was a bit stressful due to deadlines, the final assessment is good as I feel that I have learned useful lessons for my future projects.

- Sometimes you want to incorporate many of the elements and techniques worked on in class, making the projects more complex. It is often better to start with simple things and increase the complexity as you get the parts to work correctly.

- When we get stuck with a piece of programming code it can cause us a lot of trouble and cause us to waste a lot of time and energy. Using chatGPT to debug and find possible errors has been, on some occasions, useful for us.

- Another lesson that I take away is that it is not good to change from one solution to another every time we encounter small obstacles. Maybe we don't find how to develop the first option, then we move on to a second but we also get stuck and, then, we return to the first and so on. Deciding on a solution and spending time researching it is sometimes better than changing every moment. However, wasting a lot of time on a dead end is also dangerous. Deciding that it is worth investing more resources in a solution or deciding that it is time to stop because you are wasting your time is something you never know for sure.

**The importance of planning:**

-Although the whole project was a little stressful due to the timelines, I must confess that I have learned very valuable lessons for my future projects.

Planning is very important. As we started from a good project planning thanks to microchallenge 1, we have not spent much time deciding what to do and how to do it. Having planned most of our project in advance has allowed the new ideas to fit perfectly without leaving the predetermined framework.

The previous daily meeting to evaluate the status of the project and decide the objectives and distribution of each day's tasks is a very good practice.

**The importance of the previous experience:**

We have done in one day what took us 4 days in the previous microchallenge, which tells us about the importance of the experience.

**The importance of the team:**

Al continuar trabajando con el mismo equipo, nos ha permitido conocer mejor la manera de trabajar y las habilidades de cada miembro del equipo nos ha permitido segregar algunos de los trabajos para poder acabar dentro de las fechas l√≠mite.

Being understanding and having fun working with colleagues is essential to cope well under the pressure of deadlines.

### Contributions

- My contribution to the project may have to be valued by my partner in this microchallenge. However, if I have to evaluate myself, I think I have tried to convey serenity and good vibes to the team as well as commitment to the work we were doing.

- I have been able to make some very small contributions to the other groups whenever I have had the chance. Helping others not only makes me feel good, it is also an opportunity to learn from what they do.

### The process is the way!
