# **Digital Prototyping For Design: Prototyping for interaction**

![Citlali Hernandez presentation](../../images/T3_DP4D_M4_presentation.PNG){width=300px}

In this seminar we had the opportunity to test different open source tools such as Wekinator (real-time machine learning), code tools such as Processing or real-time communication protocols as OSC.

We were also able to build a wearable textile sensor from scratch. With the help of a development board with connectivity, in this case Barduino, we saw how the data taken by the sensor could be sent in real time over the Internet through a Wi-Fi network (in this case internal) for processing and graphical and audio representation. or for training your own artificial intelligence model.

##Exercices

With conductive and semiconductive fabrics we build a sensor for the finger. After checking its resistivity, we built a simple circuit to be able to send the data through the ESP32 and an internal Wi-Fi, to the computer where we played with different representation and machine learning training possibilities with Wekinator i Processing.

### Reflections

- Short and productive seminar, in my opinion, very interesting and that provides us with more resources for our future projects.

- Building the diy sensor ourselves increased our understanding of how it works.

- I really liked the possibility of working on these topics exclusively with open source softwares. I feel like I need a little more time to play with these softwares. I hope to have the possibility in future projects.

- I really want to continue experimenting with topics of interaction, processing and representation. I see that they open up a lot of very interesting possibilities from an artistic point of view but also from a product design point of view.
