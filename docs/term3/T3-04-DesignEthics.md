# **Design Ethics**

Some insights from the class:

- Technology is always present but often not evident
- Even what may seem more natural to us like a forest or cattle grazing on a mountain can have a lot of technology behind it
- The technology context is inevitable, the technosphere is everywhere where humanity is or has passed through.
- Technology and technosphere are materialization of the values that society upholds.
- Humans interacts with and are shaped by artifacts.
- Technology shape our way of see the world.
- Values are embedded in the tech so they canâ€™t be neutral.
