# **Design Ethics**

This short and intense seminar, given by Ariel Guersenzvaig has introduced us to a bunch of concepts, theories and theorists around technology. 

??? quote "Ideas to reflect on carefully"

- Technology is always present but often not evident. Even what may seem more natural to us like a forest or some cattle grazing on a mountain can have a lot of technology behind it.

- The "omnipresence" of technology wherever there are humans creates the technosphere that mixes with the biosphere to configure our environment.

- The technology context is inevitable, the technosphere is everywhere where humanity is or has passed through.

- Technology and technosphere are the materialization of the values that society upholds.

- Humans interacts with and are shaped by artifacts. Technology shape our way of see the world.

- As values are embedded in the tech, tech it canâ€™t be neutral.
