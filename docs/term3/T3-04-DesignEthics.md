# **Design Ethics**

## Reflections and insights

- Technology is always present but often not evident. Even what may seem more natural to us like a forest or some cattle grazing on a mountain can have a lot of technology behind it.

- The technology context is inevitable, the technosphere is everywhere where humanity is or has passed through.

- Technology and technosphere are the materialization of the values that society upholds.

- Humans interacts with and are shaped by artifacts. Technology shape our way of see the world.

- As values are embedded in the tech, tech it canâ€™t be neutral.
