# **Design Ethics**

This short and intense seminar, given by Ariel Guersenzvaig has introduced us to a bunch of concepts, theories and theorists around technology. 

??? quote "Concepts for further reflection"

- Technology is always present but often not evident. Even what may seem more natural to us like a forest or some cattle grazing on a mountain can have a lot of technology behind it. The "omnipresence" of technology wherever there are humans creates the technosphere that mixes with the biosphere to configure our environment. The technology context is inevitable, the technosphere is everywhere where humanity is or has passed through.

- Technology and technosphere are the materialization of the values that society upholds. If this is so, we may ask ourselves: is technology, are technologies neutral? Can be neutral? Some authors such Lucy Suchman argue that technologies cannot be neutral because they are the fruit of social and cultural contexts that develop, use and interpret them. Or as Judy Wajcman says, technologies emphatize the power roles of those who control them, perpetuating inequalities. According to Donna Haraway, "Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us...". Nassim Parvin and Bruno Latour también sostienen esta idea del propósito y las implicaciones de la tecnología y como esta modula las aciones humanas.

- Humans interacts with and are shaped by artifacts. Technology shape our way of see the world.
