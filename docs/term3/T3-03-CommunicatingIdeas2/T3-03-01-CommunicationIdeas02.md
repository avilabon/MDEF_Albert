# **Communicating ideas 02. Notes, references and reflections**


## Session 1:
In general terms and having reviewed our final works, we are encouraged to find a greater definition of the projects and to use appropriate language to communicate with others and not only with ourselves.

Everyone knows different things and comes from different backgrounds for this reason, when communicating our project it is essential to adapt the speech to the level of each listener or the person with whom we are having a conversation.

It has been pointed out to us that in our environment we are using quite technical and specific language that we have to take into account when transferring it to all situations because not everyone is familiar with it.

    1. Start off in the right place. Ask a question to ensure understanding: Do you understand? Try to guess if the auditorium is going well, come back if necessary.
    2. Don't go too far down the rabbit hole. People can take in a certain amount of information. Don't give them so much that they don't remember.
    3. Go for clarity over accuracy. Better to go with a simple explanation than a precise one.
    4. Explain why you think your subject is so cool. Explain what is exciting and generate curiosity.

## General reflexions:
- Talking about the future is easy for people, the capacity for abstraction defines us as humans, it is in our DNA. I think that at MDEF we deal with topics that people like, most of us want a different future and to change the things that are not going well. In my opinion, we have the first obstacle to communication that would be the topic of conversation, we just have to be careful in using the language, tone, words or images appropriate to the listeners.
